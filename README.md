# ml-monocular-distance-estimation
A machine learning-based non-linear regression model to accurately predict the real-world distance of an object using images captured from a single (monocular) camera. The project leverages camera calibration, pixel-size analysis, and temporal tracking techniques to provide cost-effective, accurate distance estimation.
